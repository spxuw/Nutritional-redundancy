# Nutritional-redundancy
We have tested this code for MATLAB 2016a.

## This repository contains:
(1) The food profile of DMAS (Johnson, A. J. et al. Daily Sampling Reveals Personalized Diet-Microbiome Associations in Humans. Cell Host & Microbe 25, 789-802.e5 (2019)) and Food-Nutrient network constcuted from FNDDS 2011-2012.

(2) Matlab scripts (NR_FNN_randomization.m & NR_composition_randomization.m): The matlab code imports the food profile table and Food-nutrient network, calculates the nutritional redundancy for the real abundance and Food-nutrient network and also for the randomized counterpart, and then plot the figures.

(3) Matlab functions used by the scripts.
